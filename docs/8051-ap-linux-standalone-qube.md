Hello everyone,
I am hoping there might be some other audiophiles here in the forum.
I have the idea of installing AP Linux into a standalone qube to play hires music, but am not having much luck creating a standalone qube.
The installation process for AP Linux is a bit more complex than some other linux installs so I switched to a couple of other easy installs to try to get them to work first.
Following the instructions in:
https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/standalones-and-hvms/
with all attempted installations the installer will start and then the qube will shutdown fairly shortly after beginning.
I am running Qubes 4.1 Rc2, and have tried everything I can think of, using both the GUI and command line procedures, changing memory and disk space qube settings but am stuck.
Any help, advise or general comments would be greatly appreciated, also keen to know if there are any other audiophiles here :)
