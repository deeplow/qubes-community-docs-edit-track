**What this is**: hopefully a helpful resources for others. I compiled this resources for certain beginner problems I ran into on my way to switch all my fedora-xx template based qubes to fedora-xx-minimal template.

**What this is not**: a guide to tweak everything to the most minimal regarding RAM, CPU and HD usage.

Networking including wifi, usb, audio and video playback now works. Not surprising: most problems I ran into were due to missing packages.

**Problems with networking in general:**

–> Fedora

**Problem template asks for password when using sudo (passwordless-root):**
https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/minimal/
–> Passwordless root

**Problem audio and/or video playback not working or very jerky:**

**Problem with installing from certain repositories (e.g. rpmfusion-free-release-tainted):**
