Hello everyone. I’m am completely new to qubes and I’m trying to play around in it to create safeguards for myself as I have had my identity taken but I’m come to a roadblock. Any who I’m trying to route my NetVM to the FirewallVM. From there, route the traffic to the VPN VM then setup my VPN VM to route all traffic to the VPN tunnel and restrict all non-VPN connections with iptables rules. Someone please help as the github that shows this is gone.
