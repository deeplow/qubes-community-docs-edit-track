Hello,

Has anyone succeed to run Anbox inside Whonix on the Qubes 4.0?

This [how-to](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anbox) looks easy but I struggle with the understanding (how it works) of the headers/VM kernel and some of the required modules ashmem and binder.

Else, has anyone managed to run an Android (even AndroidX86) inside a Qubes? I would like to avoid to build my own .iso (300GB disk storage that I don't have)
