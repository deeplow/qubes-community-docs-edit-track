Hello guys,

I would like to know if there is a way to physically hide data to peoples if they force me to give my passphrase.

So I would like to know if there isn't a way to get like two password, one password connect my pc to my real QubesOS, and the other one connect me to a blank QubesOS never used. So I always use the real password, and give the fake one if i'm forced to.

It was just an exemple, i'm taking all ideas, bye guys
