Hello guys!

I would like to provide a solution for anyone who is having a problem updating the debian template on QubesOS. I've been trying to update for many days, and Debian just won't update. Returned the message:

Updating debian-11 Error on updating debian-11: Command '['sudo',
'qubesctl', '--skip-dom0', '--targets=debian-11', '--show-output',
'state.sls', 'update.qubes-vm']' returned non-zero exit status 20.
debian-11:
   ---------- ID: update Function: pkg.uptodate Result: False Comment:
        Problem encountered upgrading packages. Additional info follows:

   ------------ Total states run: 2 Total run time: 14,454 s

The solution for this, assuming the time is correct on the system, is to open a terminal in Template: debian-11, accessible through the menu in Dom0, type the command:

sudo dpkg --configure -a

This topic is for newbies, as this solution is proposed in the error message itself, but the exact place to run the command is in a terminal in the debian template.
