# Problem 

Currently no **proper guide** exists on how to create and use `sys-audio` (AudioVM) in R4.1/R4.2.

* Qubes OS Documentation **does not have a single article** about it.
* Qubes Community Documentations also has **nothing** at all about it.

# Consequences

So many people are trying to create `sys-audio` qube to listen to Bluetooth headphones and almost nothing helps or guides them except several forum topics which **are mess**: full of different information combined with useless, outdated or random messages on different topics. Almost nobody can set `sys-audio` to work properly in full.

# Solution proposal

So, I am asking people who is savvy enough or/and have a properly working sys-audio to:
1) Provide a detailed, up-to-date step-by-step guide how to create and set a sys-audio qube for having sound in it from the very beginning. Majority of steps should have an explanation of what (and why) is happening and how to test that the result of the step is right (check with aplay, reboot and check processes, look for something in pavucontrol and etc).
2) Explain how exactly the sound data should be moved by qubes tools by design for future Qubes OS versions that will include sys-audio be default similar to how sys-usb is used nowadays.
3) Provide a guide how to use Bluetooth headphones in this sys-audio qube to play sound in headphones.
4) Provide a guide how to make the sound work in Windows qubes too (currently this topic is even messier, some patches of qemu and etc).


Let's hope that someone (or multiple users) will try to do this important job for the greater good of others. It will be very appreciated.
I can make such guides myself but currently I am not able to set `sys-audio` for myself, facing multiple issues and lack of straight-forward information on the topic.
