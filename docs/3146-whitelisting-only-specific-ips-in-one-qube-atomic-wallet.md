Hi there.

I installed one Qube called: "atomic-qube"
In that Qube I will only have one program called : "atomicwallet.AppImage"
https://get.atomicwallet.io/download/atomicwallet.AppImage


Currently I trust in this APP, but maybe in future I will not.
When I start this APP it should connect to a remote server : "xx.xx.xx.xx" and check my Crypto balance.

Currently I do not know which IP address is that, nor if there are another IP addresses. 

All I want to know is how to see :


1. All active IP connections in this Qube.


After seeing active connections, I can whitelist **only that** connections in firewall.

In the future, if I download infected new updated Atomic application, this application wouldn't be able to connect to a remote RAT server, because I whitelisted only Atomic Servers ??

Does this make any sense ? or I am thinking wrong.

Short info:

I am using Atomic Wallet since they were Beta version.
Never ever had any problem whit this wallet.
My Private keys and seed are very good protected since I do not download any new versions.
But now I want to download new version, because I want to have new Coins in my list, some coins in which I want to invest.
My version 1 had support for a top 5 Cryptos.
I know this version is not infected with any kind man-in-the-middle , or any kind of trojan.

So how can I inspect this app and limit my firewall only to those IPs ?

and what will happened if I downloaded infected app and my firewall is good configured ?
will attacker still have access to my seed , no-matter his server is not Whitelisted ???



thx to all who can help and more tnx to those how try to help

live long and prosper
