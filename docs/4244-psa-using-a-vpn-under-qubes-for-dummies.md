Installing a VPN can be difficult, the mailing list and forum are full 
of examples. Hence my advice:

1) pick a provider that offers OpenVPN
2) follow these instructions: 
https://github.com/QubesOS-contrib/qubes-tunnel
3) be done with it

I don't mean to imply anything about OpenVPN/Wireguard, various scripts 
etc. This post is meant to safe the so-called "non-technical" user or 
the one that has other stuff to do but needs a VPN qube NOW a lot of 
time an nerves. The above works.
