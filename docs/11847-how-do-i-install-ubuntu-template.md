I just got the Purism Librem 14 and installed Qubes 4.1 on it. Ive updated all of the templates but i want to install Ubuntu Desktop as a template. 

I tried to follow [this](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/) since it lists ubuntu in the community templates

I also tried to click on the ubuntu hyperlink but it seems really complicated 

Can someone give me a step-by-step on how to install an Ubuntu Desktop template?
