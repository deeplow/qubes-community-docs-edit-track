AnarSec is a new project of tech guides for anarchist threat models, intended for an anarchist audience. Our experience with non-technical users is that they will not read documentation, which is why we are motivated to distill what they need to know in a more approachable format.

You can find the guide for Qubes OS here:

Feedback is welcome :)

We will launch the project on anarchist platforms in the near future. We wanted to solicit feedback from people who use Qubes OS before doing so.
