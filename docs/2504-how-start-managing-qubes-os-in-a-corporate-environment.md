Hey - i am new to Qubes OS but have already experience in virtualized environments and SaltStack.

We decided to start evaluating the use of Qubes OS based NitroPads as developer devices in our company. As part of that evaluation i am currently looking for a way to provide a basic corporate wide basic setup of the devices, f.e. setting up basic tools and a corporate vm.

I aim for a way to provide a single command for an user to run, which ensures that all common corporate resources are installed and up to date.

I guess starting with Salt would just be it, but i am somehow lost how to connect the pieces. Am i supposed to use the admin API?

Any hint how one would get started to organize the different pieces to enable users self updating/fixing their devices in an Qubes idiomatic way would be very appreciated.

If possible i'd try to put my experience into a guide.
