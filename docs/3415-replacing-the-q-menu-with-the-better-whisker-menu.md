**edit**: this does not work on the next Qubes release (R4.1) (see [here](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/qubes-4-1-does-not-have-the-whisker-menu/6296))

`1. I couldn’t figure out the commands to install whisker menu on qubes

Whisker menu is awesome (compared to the default XFCE one) and it doesn't even have to be installed (it's already there)

I think it's comes already be installed on the system. So you can follow the following guide (from the `Add the Whisker menu to your XFCE panel` part only)

## Replacing logo

Then you can also replace the "whiskers" icon with the qubes icon. Right-clicking on the whisker menu icon » properties » Icon

And then at the top of the window that pops up you select `Location Icons` and then there should be 4 little "Q" icons (blue, green, red and yellow/orange).
