> **Description**: In this tutorial we will be easily verifying signatures to ensure that your download of the Qubes ISO is more authentic. This is important because evil, desperate people suffering from IBS and with malicious intent may try to compromise your download. Using this tutorial assumes that you are not using a compromised computer. If your computer is compromised then no amount of verifications or fancy doo-dads will help.


Below is a link to a YouTube video I made for Qubes Digital Signatures and Key Verification (Verifying Signatures).  


The audio quality is low because I had a lot of background noise when I made the audio and I did my best to remove all the background noise at the cost of audio quality.

I need help reviewing my video tutorial I made. I made it so anybody can follow along. I need one or more people to check out the video to make sure it makes sense and is easy to follow along before I make it live and is also correct. The video is currently unlisted. I still need to fill out the description part but I'm just focusing on the content at the moment.

Any and all criticism is appreciated.  Thank you.
