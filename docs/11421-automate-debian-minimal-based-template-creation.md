As [promised](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/2603/39) pretty exactly a year ago, I have at least started work on the respective guide. Today I publish a [first rough and incomplete draft](https://svensemmler.org/notes/deb-min-templates), that nevertheless should be useful.

I will keep fleshing it out. Please post all feedback, question or corrections you have into this thread and I will answer here and update in the guide as we go along. If this works and turns out to be a productive use of time both for the community and me, there could be many more 'notes' ;-)
