Hello community!
I fixed my updates on Qubes Vm's.
I was having trouble updating Whonix so I had to start whonix-ws-16
> apt update
> apt dist-upgrade

When the updater breaks, the best alternative is to enter in your system and update. Now all my updates are done directly inside each system via terminal. Hope this helps.
