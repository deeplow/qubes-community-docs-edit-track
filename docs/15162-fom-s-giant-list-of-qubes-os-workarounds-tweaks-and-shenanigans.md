Whenever I hop to a new operating system I tend to end up with pages and pages of notes on how I got said operating system working “exactly the way I want”.  This way I don’t have to waste two weeks starting from scratch if I put the OS on another computer some time in the distant future.

I love Qubes, but it’s unique nature combined with my uncanny ability to find hardware and software which hates it has necessitated my largest set of notes yet.  I’ve decided to share my notes here on the off chance they can shave a evening or two off somebody else's Qubes OS journey.  

But first, some disclaimers:
* Most of these notes were written for R4.1.1, with a little luck future releases will render some of the instructions here obsolete. 
* I am a random person on the internet.  You have no way of knowing I’m not malicious or dangerously incompetent.  If you don’t understand the commands I’ve included here google them before you go typing them into your computer.  
* The majority of the solutions here come from better informed users on these forums or elsware, I’ve just expanded on them or reworked them into a format I find easier to digest. I’ve tried to credit my sources where I’ve been able to remember them. 
* Some of these solutions have absolutely nothing to do Qubes OS whatsoever and could be necessary in any linux distro, they just happen to be things I want to do on Qubes OS.
