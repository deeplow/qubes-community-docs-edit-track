**Anyone point me toward some guide/s?**

I have never tried i2p before and am new to using Qubes but have somewhat intermediate linux (debian experience) user.

Anyway, I see *PrestiumOS* looks like a great option for an easy i2p VM...
but would like a way to learn how to setup and i2p Qube that only goes through i2p and doesn't leak also.

Not related but found a good guide for [Setting up Lokinet on Qubes](https://privsec.dev/posts/qubes/using-lokinet-on-qubes-os/)
