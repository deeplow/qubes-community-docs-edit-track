Hello, friends. 
I tried to access NAS and Network Printer on my local network from Qubes VM , but I did not have any luck. May be it is an easy thing to do, but I do not get it.

I've created a separate VM and connected it directly to sys-net. Then I realized that I should install Samba into Fedora Template. Then tried SMB from sys-net, but could not access local network anyway. I am sure that I've made some kind of mistake, but I did so many tries from different manuals that it is better to start from the scratch.

Can anyone reproduce steps on how to access Samba Network/NAS/Network Printer from QubesOS? I think it would be a valuable information for Qubes OS site, as NASes and Network Printers are very useful pieces of equipment.
