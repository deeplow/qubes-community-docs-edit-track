1. Download iso file from templeos.org download page: [https://templeos.org/Downloads/](https://templeos.org/Downloads/). I chose the Dec 2017 version.
2. Create a standalone VM with no template. Instead, boot it from CD/ROM and select your temple OS iso.
3. Follow the install prompts. You have to click on one of the drive selectors (1,2,3, or 4) and then it should install properly. You have to kill the VM since it doesn't respond to Qubes' shutdown signals.
4. If it survives a reboot you are brought to the bootloader. I picked Drive C to load from and that worked.
5. Profit.
