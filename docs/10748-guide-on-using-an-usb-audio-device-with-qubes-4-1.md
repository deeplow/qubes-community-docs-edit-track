I have bumped on this on r/Qubes yesterday. I'm still trying to make it work. I'm stuck at last command, because I don't know the syntax of usb device name in it. That is why I didn't put it to Guides.

If someone is willing to try, it would be great to share findings.

Please keep in mind that sys-audio that is mentioned there most probably is not not sys-audio in terms of Qubes 4.1
