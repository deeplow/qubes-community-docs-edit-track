According to [the debugging section of the official Qubes Salt documentation](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/salt/#debugging), I should be able to run `qubesctl`, Ctrl+Z when the disp-mgmt VM is in a transient, starting state. Then launch a terminal in the disp-mgmt VM and view logs from there. I'm following this process because (despite setting `--log-file-level=all`) the logs present in dom0 have not been detailed enough for debugging/troubleshooting purposes (`/var/log/qubes/mgmt-*` and `/var/log/salt/minion`). In most cases, `/var/log/salt/minion` is completely void of logs despite running several commands using `qubesctl`.  Attempting to spawn a terminal in the relevant disp-mgmt VM fails, both using `qvm-run` and via the Qubes managment tray icon. I tried checking `journalctl`, but couldn't find anything useful in there.
