Hi, I'm very happy to share with you this writing where I explain how to manage your Qubes OS and qubes using dom0 salt, but also more practical examples like implementing [Split SSH](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/configuration/split-ssh.md) or [Opening URLs in VMs](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/common-tasks/opening-urls-in-vms.md) only by writing Salt files :slight_smile: 

I hope you will enjoy :+1:
