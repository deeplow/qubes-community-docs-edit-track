This is a mere, non-comprehensive, ordered collection of how-to guides for split configurations, useful to achieve **security by compartmentalization**.

It is not necessarily a recommendation to implement any of the listed solutions, and as always the reader is encouraged to perform their own research.

Granted I tried to search for related keywords, I might've missed some guides, so any contribution to this list is welcome and encouraged.

NOTE: this thread is not meant for support and debug, and although I cannot predict where it will end up, it's probably best to direct those issues to the respective threads or make a new one.

All credits go to the respective authors.

With this out of the way, I hope this list can be helpful.
