I cannot find sys-usb don't I need that?
I am reading the documentation but I just started today and I have 2 things I need to get going pretty quick.
 My wireless mouse dongle is usb right?
And my wireless head phones, it is tough trying to watch videos with not sound.
 For right now I would like to get usb going, I see usb packages that I can install but questions is don't I need sys-usb? If I need to create that myself where should I put it. I want to keep this install clean untill I know enough to really screw it up.  : )
