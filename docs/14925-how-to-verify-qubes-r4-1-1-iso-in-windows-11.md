This probably posted a hundred time, but I'm lost. 

After reading https://www.qubes-os.org/security/verifying-signatures/ 
and installing gpg4win 4.0.4. I think by copy paste 
[https:]//keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc
does the trick to download the key, but the next steps are using linux `gpg2`. Something about web of trust. 

There are a lot of verifications need to be done. I'm kind of paralysis by it. Is there a page dedicated to window 11 methods in verifying Qubes iso?
