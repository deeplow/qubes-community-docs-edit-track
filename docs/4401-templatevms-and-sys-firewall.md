Stupid question,

Did you enable sys-firewall in your templateVM qubes?

Every article I've read casually describes installing software in TemplateVMs.. while the default TemplateVMs don't have networking enabled.

My guess is that templateVMs don't have networking for a good reason, but I'm struggling to reason about best practices for setting up my AppVMs.
