Hi,

I pushed an update for the community guide explaining how to install the nvidia driver on dom0, https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/pull/262

However, I was curious to know if people are using the kmod solution with success, it recommends using Fedora 18 which make me thing it may not be used regularly...

(that's also the opportunity for me to make a thread about a successful nvidia driver installation and help future users, because the forum didn't have any from my search :D )
